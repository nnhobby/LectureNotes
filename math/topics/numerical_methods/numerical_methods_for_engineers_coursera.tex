\section{Logistic Map}

Mathematically, the logistic map is written
\begin{equation}
    \label{eq:logistic_map}
    x_{n+1} = r x_n (1 - x_n),
\end{equation}
where $r$ (sometimes also denoted $\mu$) is a positive constant.

\subsection{Fixed Point}
The fixed point means that some point satisfies $x = f(x)$. By solving 
\begin{equation*}
    x = rx(1-x), \quad x = 0 \quad \text{or}\quad  x = 1 - \frac{1}{r}
\end{equation*}


\subsection{Period-2 Point}
We say that $x_1$ and $x_2$ are a period-2 cycle of a one-dimensional map $f(x)$ if
\begin{equation*}
x_2 = f(x_1) \quad\textrm{and}\quad  x_1 = f(x_2) \quad\textrm{and}\quad x_1 \ne x_2 . 
\end{equation*}
Determine the period-2 cycle for the logistic map by solving the equation $x = f(f(x))$,
with $f(x) = rx(1-x)$.
